This is the latest [Minimum Viable Plasma](https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-viable-plasma/426) version.  

**Note**: This sidechain is being constructed to be compatible with our [rootchain contract](https://github.com/FourthState/plasma-mvp-rootchain/master)  

## Overview
As a layer 2 scaling solution, Plasma has two major components: verification and computation. Verification is handled by the rootchain contract which resolves any disputes and distributes funds accordingly. 

Computation is handled separately by a sidechain. This sidechain leverages the Cosmos SDK to create a scalable and flexible blockchain, that can maintain it's security through reporting merkle roots to the root chain. We will be using [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) for consensus on this blockchain. 

We are using a UTXO model for this blockchain. This allows us to do secure and compact proofs when interacting with the rootchain contract. 

## Starting a sidechain

In order to run a sidechain with tendermint consensus and a client to form transaction, a plasma node and light client will need to be initialized. 

**Note**: The following assumes you have [golang](https://golang.org/) properly setup and all dependecies have already been installed. See [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/FourthState/plasma-mvp-sidechain/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

Plasma Node:

- Navigate to `client/plasmad/` directory
- Run `go install` via command line

The plasma node (plasmad) is now installed and can be called from any directory with `plasmad`

Run `plasmad init` via command line to start an instance of a plasma node with a connection to a tendermint validator.

Run `plasmad start` via command line to begin running the plasma node. You should see empty blocks being proposed and committed.

Plasma Light Client:

- Navigate to `client/plasmacli/` directory
- Run `go install` via command line

Use `plasmacli` to run any of the commands for this light client

The light client uses the Ethereum keystore to create and store passphrase encrypted keys in `$HOME/.plasmacli/keys/`

### dep ensure 
When building the sidechain, go dep is used to manage dependencies. 
Running `dep ensure` followed by `go build` will result in the following output:

```
# github.com/FourthState/plasma-mvp-sidechain/vendor/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/crypto/secp256k1
../vendor/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/crypto/secp256k1/curve.go:42:44: fatal error: libsecp256k1/include/secp256k1.h: No such file or directory
```
This is caused by a go dep issue outlined [here](https://github.com/tools/godep/issues/422).
To fix this locally, add the following in Gopkg.lock under `crypto/secp256k1` and above `crypto/sha3`:

```
"crypto/secp256k1/libsecp256k1",
"crypto/secp256k1/libsecp256k1/include",
"crypto/secp256k1/libsecp256k1/src",
"crypto/secp256k1/libsecp256k1/src/modules/recovery",
```

Run `dep ensure -vendor-only`

Your vendor folder should now contain all the necessary dependencies, there is no need to run `dep ensure` again.
