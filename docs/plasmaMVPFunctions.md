# PlasmaMVP Documentation

The transaction bytes, `txBytes`, in the contract follow the convention:  
```
RLP_ENCODE ([
  [Blknum1, TxIndex1, Oindex1, DepositNonce1, Owner1, Input1ConfirmSig,

   Blknum2, TxIndex2, Oindex2, DepositNonce2, Owner2, Input2ConfirmSig,

   NewOwner, Denom1, NewOwner, Denom2, Fee],

  [Signature1, Signature2]
])
```
```solidity
function submitBlock(bytes32[] blocks, uint256[] txnsPerBlock, uint256[] feesPerBlock, uint256 blockNum)
```
The validator submits an array of block headers in ascending order. Each block can be of variable block size(capped at 2^16 txns per block). The total number of transactions per block must be passed in through `txnsPerBlock`. The amount of transaction fees collected by the validator per block must be passed in through `feesPerBlock`.
`blockNum` must be the intended block number of the first header in this call. Ordering is enforced on each call. `blockNum == lastCommittedBlock + 1`.

```solidity
function deposit(address owner)
```
Entry point into the child chain. The user has the option to create a spendable utxo owned by the address, `owner`. Once created,
the private keys of the `owner` address has complete control of the new utxo.

Deposits are not recorded in the child chain blocks and are entirely represented on the rootchain. Each deposit is identified with an incremental nonce.
Validators catch deposits through event handlers and maintain a collection of spendable deposits.
```solidity
mapping(uint256 => depositStruct) deposits; // The key is the incrementing nonce
struct depositStruct {
    address owner,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 ethBlockNum,
    uint256 createdAt
}
```

<br />

```solidity
function startTransactionExit(uint256[3] txPos, bytes txBytes, bytes proof, bytes confirmSignatures, uint256 committedFee)
```
`txPos` follows the convention - `[blockNumber, transactionIndex, outputIndex]`

Exit procedure for exiting a utxo on the child chain(not deposits). The `txPos` locates the transaction on the child chain. The leaf, hash(hash(`txBytes`), `sigs`) is checked against the block header using the `proof`.
The `confirmSignatures` represent the acknowledgement of the inclusion by both inputs. If only one input was used to create this transactions, only one confirm signature should be passed in for the corresponding
input. However, if there are two distinct inputs in the exiting transactions, both confirm signatures should be appended together in order for a total of 130 bytes. The owner of the exit must commit to any fees payed, `committedFee`.

A valid exit satisfies the following properties:
  - Exit has not previously been finalized or challenged
  - The creator of this exit posted a sufficient bond. Excess funds are refunded the the senders rootchain balance and are immediately withdrawable.
  - If present, the confirm signatures are correct and signed by the same address which signed the corresponding input signatures.

<br />

```solidity
function startDepositExit(uint256 nonce, uint256 committedFee)
```
Exit procedure for deposits that have not been spent. Deposits are purely identified by their `nonce`. The caller's address must match the owner of the deposit.
A valid exit must satisfy the same constraints listed above for normal utxo exits except confirm signatures. Deposits exits are also collected into their own seperate queue from normal transactions.
This is because of the differing priority calculation. The priority of a deposit is purely it's nonce while the priority of a utxo is calculated from it's location in the child chain. The owner of the exit must
commit to any fee, `committedFee`.

<br />

```solidity
function startFeeExit(uint256 blockNumber, uint256 committedFee)
```
The validator of any block should call this function to exit the fees they've collected for that particular block.
The validator declares the `blockNumber` of the block for which they'd like to exit fees. This exit is then added to exit queue with the lowest priority for that block.
Note that if the validator attempts to start an exit for a fee-UTXO that has already been spent in a later block, the exit can be challenged through `startTransactionExit` the same way as a regular transaction exit.

<br />

```solidity
function challengeExit(uint256[4] exitingTxPos, uint256[2] challengingTxPos, bytes txBytes, bytes proof, bytes confirmSignature)
```
`challengingTxPos` follows the convention - `[blockNumber, transactionIndex]`  
`exitingTxPos` follows the convention - `[blockNumber, transactionIndex, outputIndex, depositNonce`]

A uxto that has starting an exit phase but was already spent on the child chain can be challenged using this function call. A successful challenge awards the caller with the exit bond.
The `exitingTxPos` locates the malicious utxo and is used to calculate the priority. `challengingTxPos` locates the transaction that is the child (offending transaction is an input into this tx).
The `proof`, `txBytes` and `sigs` is sufficient for a proof of inclusion in the child chain of the parent transaction. The `confirmSignature`, signed by the owner of the malicious transaction,
acknowledges the inclusion of it's parent in the plasma chain and allows anyone with this confirm signature to challenge a malicious exit of the child.

An operator can also use this function to do a fee mismatch challenge. In this case, the confirm singature can be empty. The exitingTxPos must be the first input of the challenging transaction
and must have a mismatch in the committed fee. The first transaction signature is checked against to prevent the operator for performing invalid inclusions to challenge any exit.

<br />

```solidity
function finalizeTransactionExits()
```
Process all "finalized" exits in the priority queue. "Finalized" exits are those that have been in the priority queue for at least one week and have not been proven to be malicious through a challenge.

<br />

```solidity
function finalizeDepositExits()
```
Process all "finalized" deposit exits in the priority queue. "Finalized" exits are those that have been in the priority queue for at least one week and have not been proven to be malicious through a challenge.

<br />

```solidity
function withdraw()
```
Sender withdraws all funds associated with their balance from the contract.

<br />

```solidity
function balanceOf(address _address) returns (uint256 amount)
```
Getter for the withdrawable balance of `_address`

<br />

```solidity
function plasmaChainBalance() returns (uint256 funds)
```
Query the total funds of the plasma chain
